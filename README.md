- ðŸ‘‹ Hi, Iâ€™m @KrystianCoder2
- ðŸ‘€ Iâ€™m interested Programming, and game development.
- ðŸŒ± Iâ€™m currently learning Rust

- I'll try to post on this account a lot of coding projects in languages like:
- C++,
- Java,
- Rust,
- HTML/CSS/JavaScript.

To code i use:
{ Visual Studio 2022 - for C++ ( I highly recommend using this IDE because its really easy to use ),
{ Visual Studio Code - for Rust, Web Development ( For me it's the best code editor ),
{ IntelliJ IDEA - for Java ( Really good IDE for Java that is free )
